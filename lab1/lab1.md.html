**Assignment 1: Projection and Rotation**

Key Algorithm: Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
============================

Line Drawing Algorithm is to determine which pixel to be chosen as a part of a rasterized segment.
The main purpose is to choose the nearest pixel to the intersection of discreted segment using the least computation.
It's based on method that step by step calculate the intersection, but using many trick to simplify the computation.

Assume the function of the segment is $y = f(x)$. As the intercept is always canceled out, we can just omit it.

Suppose the possition of current intersection is $(x_i, y_i)$, the chosen pixel is $(x_i, \hat{y}_i)$. The $\hat{y}_i$ is defined as follow:
\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_i = \left\{
    \begin{array}{rl} 
        \lfloor y_i \rfloor & y_i - \lfloor y_i \rfloor \leq 0.5 \\ 
        \lfloor y_i \rfloor + 1 & \lfloor y_i \rfloor + 1 - y_i \leq 0.5 \\  
    \end{array}
    \right.
\end{equation}

How to determined that if we need to step forward one grid in y axis? We can use a simple trick to check that. Notice
that the following derivation is based on the fact that the slope of the segment is between $[0, 0.5]$.
Assume we are at $(x_i, y_i)$, thus grid $(x_i, \hat{y}_i)$ is chosen.
For the next intersection $(x_{i + 1}, y_{i + 1})$, the corresponding grid is either $(x_{i} + 1, \hat{y}_i)$ or $(x_i +
1, \hat{y}_i + 1$. (Because y is increasing less than half of the grid.)

We can use distance to determine which y is closer.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
d_{up} & = \hat{y}_i + 1 - y_{i + 1} \\
d_{down} & = y_{i + 1} - \hat{y}_i \\
\Delta &= d_{up} - d_{down}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

If $\Delta < 0$, which means the intersection is closer to the grid above than the other one, vice versa. Expand the formula of $\Delta$ and we can get: 
\begin{equation} 
\begin{aligned} 
    \Delta &=d_{up} - d_{down}=2\hat{y}_i + 1 - 2y_{i + 1} \\ 
            &=2\hat{y}_i + 1 - 2 (a (x_i + 1) + b) \\ 
            &=2\hat{y}_i + 1 - 2ax_i - 2a - 2b 
\end{aligned} 
\end{equation}

We know that $a = \frac{d_y}{d_x}$. (In practice we usually draw a segment whose start point and end point is known.) 
Moreover, Only $\Delta$'s sign is useful. We can use $d_x, d_y$ to remove the division from the equation.

\begin{equation}
\Delta_{i + 1} = 2 d_x \hat{y}_i + d_x - 2 d_y x_i - 2d_y - 2 d_x b
\end{equation}

Add a subscript to indicate that this $\Delta$ is used for $x_{i + 1}, y_{i + 1}$, And we find this can be written as a recursive function:
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{i + 1} = \Delta_{i} + 2 d_x (\hat{y}_i - \hat{y}_{i-1}) - 2 d_y \\
\Delta_1 = 2\hat{y}_0 + 1 - 2ax_0 - 2a - 2b = 2y_0 + 1 - 2a - 2(ax_0 + b) = 1 - 2a 
\end{equation}

We use the fact that $(x_0, y_0)$ is just the chosen grid. So we just maintain the $\Delta$. 
If it is negative, increase by $-2d_y$ and assign $\hat{y}_{i+1}$ as $\hat{y}_i$ . 
Otherwise, assign $\hat{y}_{i+1}$ as $\hat{y}_i + 1$ and increase $\Delta$ by $2d_x - 2d_y$.



Rotation around Axis
====================

It's easy to derive the rotatoin matrix with some basic triangular function, which is actually an simplified question in
2d plane.

Suppose vector $\mathbf{u} = (\theta, l)$, which is represented in the polar coordinate and equals to $(l cos \theta, l
\sin \theta)$, rotates $\phi$ around Z-axis (perpendicular to the plane). The rotated vector named $\mathbf{v}$ has
coordinates $(\theta + \phi, l)$ in the polar coordinate system which equals to $(l\cos (\theta + \phi), l \sin (\theta
+ \phi))$.
Expend the triangular function of the summation of angle, we can get $\mathbf{v} = (l (\cos \theta \cos \phi -
\sin\theta \sin \phi), l (\sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta))$.
The transformation formular can be written in the following matrix:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}=\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \phi & - \sin \phi \\
\sin \phi & \cos \phi\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta \\
\sin \theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}


Projection
==========

Orthorgnal Projection
---------------------
Orthorgnal projection is transforming an axis-aligned box on the canonical view volume. It can be splitted into two part: Translation and Scaling.
![transformation](figures/1.jpg)
Assume there's an AABB box with the minimum corner $(l,b,n)$ and the maximum corner $(r,t, f)$. The transformation matrix is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{P}_o=\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{s}) \mathbf{T}(\mathbf{t})&=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2}{r-l} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \frac{2}{t-b} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{2}{f-n} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{l+r}{2} \\
0 & 1 & 0 & -\frac{t+b}{2} \\
0 & 0 & 1 & -\frac{f+n}{2} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\\
&=\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2}{r-l} & 0 & 0 & -\frac{r+l}{r-l} \\
0 & \frac{2}{t-b} & 0 & -\frac{t+b}{t-b} \\
0 & 0 & \frac{2}{f-n} & -\frac{f+n}{f-n} \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}



Perspective Projection
---------------------
Perspective projection is to transform a frustum into a unit cube, so called canonical view volume. We can first transform the frustum into a cuboid and then apply orthorgnal projection.

What we do first is to shrink the extended part into a cuboid while keeping the front face and the distance to the far plane as the depth of the cuboid.

![](figures/2.png)

Use the property of similarity of triangles, we can get the transformation rules for x and y axis:

![](figures/3.png)
$$
x_{new} = x \cdot \frac{z_{near}}{z} \\
y_{new} = y \cdot \frac{z_{near}}{z}
$$
Because the transformation depends on the value of $z$, we can use the property of homogeneous coordinates.

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
a & b & c & d \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{z_{near}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y\\
z \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Because we introduce the $\frac{z}{z_{near}}$, the transformation for z coordinate should be considered more carefully. As the z coordinate for points on the near and far plane should not be changed. 
We substitute $z_{near}$ and $z_{far}$ into the matrix to get:
\begin{equation}
ax + by + cz_{near} + d = z_{near} \\
ax + by + cz_{far} + d = z_{far}
\end{equation}

solve it and get:
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \dfrac{z_{near} + z_{far}}{z_{near}} & -z_{far} \\
0 & 0 & \dfrac{1}{z_{near}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Notice that in this lab, the znear and zfar are given by positive numbers but the model is located with negative z. 
We need to verify them to be towards the same direction.



Rotation around Abritory Vector
==========================

The main idea is to simplify this problem into a much easier one, such as rotation around an axis. We know that two
non-parallel vector determine a plane. We can then switch the problem to a standard coordinate system.

Assume a vector $\mathbf{v}$ are required to rotate around another vector $\mathbf{u}$. Let $\mathbf{t} = \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{u}$ be the tangent vector. 
$\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{t} = \mathbf{u} \otimes ( \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{u})$.

Then the rotation can be represented as the translation in two orthorgnal directions. $\mathbf{v'} = \mathbf{v} + a\mathbf{t} + b\mathbf{bt}$. Easily, $a = \sin \theta, b = 1 - \cos \theta$.
So the final formula is 
$$
\mathbf{v'} = \mathbf{v} + \sin \theta(\mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{u}) + (1-\cos \theta)\mathbf{u} \otimes ( \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{u})
$$
